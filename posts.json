And if you care deeply about issues like climate change, social justice, and economic equality—and want to work on interesting projects that make a meaningful positive impact on them—then we think you’ll love working with us and our clients.\r\n\r\n\r\n**A bit about the role**\r\n\r\nSr. Web Developers at Constructive need great expertise both in creating powerful back-end publishing systems and in elegant front-end digital experiences. They need to write code that’s semantically sound and adheres to current best practices. They must be proactive thinkers who are always looking to bring new ideas to the table and improve how we work. And they must thrive on working collaboratively in multi-disciplinary teams. \r\n\r\n**A bit about us**\r\n\r\nWe’re a diverse, close-knit bunch who are serious about having fun producing exceptional work. We play to win—for our clients, for ourselves, and for the world. We’ve got each other’s backs. We have high expectations and the work ethic to match them. And we’re all together in the same open office, so there’s music and a lot of joking mixed-in with being heads-down on work.\r\n\r\n**A bit about diversity**\r\n\r\nWe believe strongly that diversity is one of our greatest strengths—that the more perspectives we bring to the mix, the better we are as people and the better partner we are for our clients.

Seriously, life can be stressful enough these days.\r\n\r\n**Expertise that’s important in our work**\r\n\r\nRight now, these are the specific technologies and tasks that are essential to our work (which we always remain open to evaluating and evolving). We’ll need you to have about 5 years of professional experience in most of these things.\r\n\r\n- Expert-level Wordpress Development (Min 3 years experience)\r\n\r\n- Expert CSS chops (and SCSS!)\r\n\r\n- Strong front-end development experience (experience with at least 1 Javascript framework: React, Angular, Vue)\r\n\r\n- Strong preprocessor experience (Webpack / Gulp)\r\n\r\n- Strong Git experience\r\n\r\n- Experience with MySQL\r\n\r\n- Experience executing third-party integrations (Salesforce, Mailchimp, Blackbaud, Fluxx, Google Maps API, etc.)\r\n\r\n- Comfortable with D3\r\n\r\n- Comfortable with AWS\r\n\r\n- Comfortable with Server Administration & DevOps\r\n\r\n**What’s in it for you?**\r\n\r\nWe do our best to make sure everyone at Constructive is taken care of with a great mix of salary, benefits and perks, opportunities for professional growth, and a healthy dose of time off.

You’ve been around the block. You know how projects project, how developers develop, how budgets budget, how clients client. You know all the acronyms, the old ones and the new ones. Not much surprises you anymore. Let’s face it, you’re kind of a big deal. But are you arrogant about it? On the contrary! Has it made you jaded? Don’t be silly.\r\n\r\nYou’ve spent the last few years leading developers into battle at a creative agency, a startup, or a pirate ship. Maybe you’re even there now, reading these very words, wondering if they’re meant for you. (They are.)\r\n\r\nEverybody loves you, obviously. Why? Let’s see.\r\n\r\nDevelopers love you because they can look to you for leadership, guidance, mentoring, and general good cheer. You trust them and they trust you. You may not always have all the answers, but you help figure things out. And you’re not afraid to get your hands dirty when needed.\r\n\r\nDesigners love you because you always dress in black. Just kidding. They love you because you love them, frankly. You know how to mesh tech and dev, and you love experimenting with the two. You make them better at what they do, and they make you better at what you do.\r\n\r\nClients love you because you speak their language. You understand what they’re trying to do, why they’re trying to do it, and how to get it done.\r\n\r\nCEOs love you because you’re not shy about telling them when they’re wrong about something.\r\n\r\nThe rest of us love you because you’re good and friendly human being who knows what you’re talking about, without being an asshole about it. And maybe because you let us win at Rocket League.\r\n\r\nTime for bullet points … Experience. You’ve got it. Technology. You know it. Team. You lead it. Clients. They get you, you get them. Projects. When you’re around they seem to magically get done.\r\n\r\nAnd for your reference, a non-exclusive list of some of the things we’ve tended to work with in the past but are by no means married to: React, Vue, React Native Mobx, Mobx-state-tree and Redux TypeScript, SCSS and PostCSS Jest, Enzyme, and other testing libraries Headless CMSs like Prismic and Contentful GitHub, Heroku, AWS and other CI tools E-Commerce platforms\r\n\r\nSo. What do you think? Sounds like you? Say hi and introduce yourself using the form here below. (Nothing bad will happen.)\r\n\r\nWe will only consider candidates with US work permits.

Right now, we have 8 exceptional people on our team and we are looking to grow our business rapidly, but we want to keep the team size relatively small and nimble. \r\n\r\nCurrently we have 1000+ customers using our SaaS WordPress plugin, and we&#39;re looking to ship some really exciting new (non-WordPress) search products in 2019. This is an opportunity to get in right at the start of development of these new platforms. We want your input, we want you constructively add to the product conversation, and have real impact on our product, company and collective futures.\r\n\r\nWe are picky about our code and the way it support our user experience. We want our codebase to be readable, maintainable, performant, reliable, and well-tested. We encourage use of language features to make code more readable, not overly clever. We aggressively code-review each other. We learn from each other, and push each other to get better. We don&#39;t shy away from hard problems; we tackle them. It&#39;s our commitment to this culture that&#39;s allowed us to support 1000+ customers with a small tech support team and allows our product team to focus on the future, not the past.\r\n\r\nWe set a very high bar for ourselves. Think you can clear it?\r\n\r\n**About You**\r\n\r\nYou are a front-end javascript developer with **4+ years of experience.** You have deep experience developing large single-page applications; but also have experience using other dynamic web application languages (ie. Rails).\r\n\r\nYou have a strong analytic mind &amp; problem solving skills. You believe in sustainable &amp; scalable code. You&#39;ve jumped on the **React bandwagon and love to help others understand how it works &amp; teaching them about best practices**. You think **code reviews** are a great practice for both coder and reviewer. You are enthusiastic about **front-end testing and code quality** ; you&#39;re experienced with **writing unit tests, end-to-end tests &amp; code reviews**.\r\n\r\nAs much as you love technology and architecture, you also love &quot; **product**&quot; -- you relish the opportunity to work with the product team and customers to ensure a **surprisingly awesome user experience**. You **ask a lot of questions** and love spirited yet professional debate, knowing it improves outcomes.
